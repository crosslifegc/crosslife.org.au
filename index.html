                            <p>We can easily feel overwhelmed in the weeks running up to Christmas. In fact, it's now extending to be the months leading up to Christmas, as the modern day cathedrals we call <em>shopping centres</em> start putting up decorations, setting out the seasonal stock, playing the Christmas tunes and launching their advertising campaigns. Why do they spend money on all this and why do we make our annual pilgrimage to the stores?</p>
                            <p> Because we have to buy gifts for our families, friends and colleagues, but why is Christmas a time of giving? Christmas is the time we celebrate God's gift to us in the Lord Jesus.
                            Our Christmas sermon series looks at God's <em>present</em> to us, the gift of life through Jesus' death on the cross, and His <em>presence</em> in us as the Holy Spirit. Then we look at how this lies behind all giving at Christmas time; to each other, to those in need and to God Himself.</p>
                            <p>Come and join us at our Helensvale or Southport campus as we prepare for Christmas by thinking about <strong>God's Presence, Our Presents</strong>.</p>

                            <!-- <p>As a child I remember every Christmas Eve walking down the hallway in our house singing "We wish you a merry Christmas" as each of the four of us children peeled off to our rooms to sleep impatiently for morning! Then I remember going to the Christmas service in the morning with the crowd singing "O Come all ye Faithful" finishing in verse 5 as the choir turned to face them "Lo Lord we greet Thee born this happy morning". Sends shivers down my spine even now!</p> -->
                            <p>Celebrating together as a family, or as a community, is something special, and Christmas is one such time. CrossLife a baptist church (the new name for the former Helensvale and Southport Baptist churches whom came together earlier this year) continues to provide the opportunity for all of us to gather together and sing carols and celebrate the birth of the Lord Jesus at Christmas.</p>
                            
                            <p>Our family friendly carols event will include carols, drama, a kid's time, birthday cake, and a <strong>FREE</strong> sausage sizzle so you don't have to worry about dinner. While the free sausage sizzle will begin at 6pm, the carols event will begin at 7pm and conclude by 8:30pm, early enough to get home before what is for most a big day ahead.</p>

                            <p>If you have any questions regarding the carols events please contact the CrossLife church office on <strong>55 733 644</strong>. Also if you are interested in finding out more about what hope there is offered in Jesus please do not hesitate in contacting us or a local Christian Church in your area.</p>

                            <p>Our commitment to serve and develop our surrounding communities on the Gold Coast led us to develop and manage the Highland Reserve Community Node at Upper Coomera in partnership with Stockland and Queensland Baptist. Here we are providing space for our Young Discoverers Long Day Care centre, a small 60n place community centre, and four community retail spaces. The node is a great partner to the park and is situated overlooking the Highland Reserve lake.</p>
                            <p>The node provides more than just services though. It is a community space with a heart for people so the whole community can benefit from a church serving its people in a variety of ways. We want to provide a haven of rest in the midst of a busy world! We imagine a place where the whole community together, businesses, the school, church and other community groups work together in a safe environment to help one another. A healthy vibrant community is good for business and good for families. And we believe it is just the sort of communities God had in mind, and the Lord Jesus wants to see blossom and grow all the more. Working alongside our new Highland Reserve CrossLife campus, we look forward to this vision becoming a reality.</p>
                            <p>At Highland Reserve, CrossLife is making its next step in helping the Gold Coast develop healthy vibrant communities where kids grow up safely and families thrive together. And behind it all in us is the Lord Jesus and His grace, strength and purpose.</p>
